# Captcha-Solver  


A simple captcha solver in python.  
This project uses PILLOW library for image processing and Google Tesseract-OCR for Optical Character recognition.  
It works on captchas like below:

---------------------------------------


## Before using the code:  
1- Install Google tessract OCR standalone and then install its library by **pip install tesseract**.  
2- Install PILLOW library for Python.  
3- Copy **tessdata** folder to tesseract install location.  
4- Run the code :)))))  


-----------------------------------


It doesn't have so much accuracy and gives good result half of the times.  
The big problem here is that tesseract doesnt recognize rotated characters.  
Any advise for making it better appreciated.
